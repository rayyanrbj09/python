# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called the **subclass** or **derived class**, and the class being inherited from is called the **superclass** or **base class**.

## Benefits of Inheritance
1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows for the reuse of existing code, reducing redundancy.
2. **Extensibility**: Subclasses can extend the functionality of the base class.
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in the base class can propagate to subclasses, making maintenance easier.

## Types of Inheritance
1. **Single Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from one superclass.
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from more than one superclass.
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from another subclass.
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.
