# Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming

## What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. Abstraction helps in reducing programming complexity and effort by providing a clear and simple interface to interact with.

## Benefits of Abstraction

- **Simplifies Code**: By hiding the complex details, abstraction makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Enhances Security**: It restricts access to certain details, thus protecting the integrity of the data.
- **Improves Modularity**: Abstraction allows you to break down complex systems into smaller, manageable pieces.

## Blueprint for Implementing Abstraction

1. **Define Abstract Class**: Create an abstract class using the `ABC` module.
2. **Declare Abstract Methods**: Use the `@abstractmethod` decorator to declare abstract methods.
3. **Implement Concrete Classes**: Create subclasses that implement the abstract methods.
4. **Instantiate Concrete Classes**: Use the concrete classes to create objects and call the implemented methods.

By following this blueprint, you can effectively use abstraction to design clean and maintainable code.
