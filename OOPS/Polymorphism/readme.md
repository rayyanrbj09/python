Polymorphism in Python
Definition
Polymorphism means "many forms." In Python, polymorphism allows different classes to use the same method name while implementing different behaviors. It enables code reusability and flexibility, making it an essential concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).

Types of Polymorphism in Python
Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)

Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
Method Overloading (Not Built-in in Python)

Unlike Java or C++, Python does not support method overloading directly. However, we can achieve it using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs).
Operator Overloading
Python allows operators to be overloaded so they can have different meanings based on the operand types.
