# Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components. This is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.

## Key Concepts of Encapsulation

1. **Private Variables**: Variables that are not accessible directly from outside the class. They are declared using a leading underscore (`_`) or double underscore (`__`).

2. **Public Methods**: Methods that provide controlled access to the private variables. These methods are accessible from outside the class.

3. **Getter and Setter Methods**: Special methods used to access and update the value of private variables.

## Benefits of Encapsulation

- **Improved Security**: By restricting access to the internal state of the object, encapsulation helps protect the data from unauthorized access and modification.
- **Modularity**: Encapsulation allows the internal implementation of a class to be changed without affecting other parts of the program.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Encapsulated code is easier to maintain and understand because it separates the internal workings of an object from its external interface.
